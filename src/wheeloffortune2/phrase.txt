Just Plain Stuck
No matter how much you try, you're not budging
Wiggle out of it
Not even close
You're not even in the ballpark
Way over yonder
Fizzled out
Fizzle's fiery twin
Bubble over
Almost tasted it
Just one bite away
Juicy and Delicious
But not enough
Just shy of plenty
Quite a few
Just seven letters
Could use a tune-Up
Fix it up
A lack of clarity
Can’t see straight
Out of focus
Too far out there
Too out there
Out of whack
This one hurt
Big oopsies
I goofed up
Fictional Character
First to get kidnapped
A damsel in distress
Fun and games
Round and round it goes
Wheel of fortune
Rhyme Time
Perfectly wrapped up with style
As snug as a bug in a rug
What are you wearing
Bright, breezy, and full of flair
A colourful poncho
A real mess
Not your tidy moment
Hot and bothered
Not fooling anyone
A disguise gone wrong
Wolf in sheep’s clothing
Everything’s spinning
Dizzy with drama
Head over heels
Too many cooks
Things got chaotic
Stirred the pot
Chill vibes
Easy breezy feeling
Cool as a cucumber
Spinning in circles
Not making progress
Round and round
Too bright to see
Completely obvious
In plain sight
Felt so close
Just slipped away
Missed the mark
Cooking chaos
Made a mess
Burnt the toast
In a hurry
Rushed and wrong
Spoke too soon
Good vibes
Feels just right
In the groove
Left on read
Still waiting...
Ghosted again
Burnt the toast
Culinary chaos
Kitchen fail
No gas left
Just vibes
Running on empty

Slow morning start
No rush at all
Lazy weekend
