Just Plain Stuck
No matter how much you try, you're not budging
Wiggle out of it
Not even close
You're not even in the ballpark
Way over yonder
Fizzled out
Fizzle's fiery twin
Bubble over
Almost tasted it
Just one bite away
Juicy and Delicious
But not enough
Just shy of plenty
Quite a few
Just seven letters
Could use a tune-Up
Fix it up
A lack of clarity
Canâ€™t see straight
Out of focus
Too far out there
Too out there
Out of whack
This one hurt
Big oopsies
I goofed up
Fictional Character
First to get kidnapped
A damsel in distress
Fun and games
Round and round it goes
Wheel of fortune
