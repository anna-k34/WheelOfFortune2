Just Plain Stuck
No matter how much you try, you're not budging
Wiggle out of it
Not even close
You're not even in the ballpark
Way over yonder
Fizzled out
Fizzle's fiery twin
Bubble over
Almost tasted it
Just one bite away
Juicy and Delicious
But not enough
Just shy of plenty
Quite a few
Just seven letters
Could use a tune-Up
Fix it up
A lack of clarity
Can’t see straight
Out of focus
Too far out there
Too out there
Out of whack
This one hurt
Big oopsies
I goofed up
Fictional Character
First to get kidnapped
A damsel in distress
Fun and games
Round and round it goes
Wheel of fortune
Rhyme Time
Perfectly wrapped up with style
As snug as a bug in a rug
What are you wearing
Bright, breezy, and full of flair
A colourful poncho
A real mess
Not your tidy moment
Hot and bothered
Everything’s spinning
Dizzy with drama
Head over heels
Too many cooks
Things got chaotic
Stirred the pot
Chill vibes
Easy breezy feeling
Cool as a cucumber
Spinning in circles
Not making progress
Round and round
Too bright to see
Completely obvious
In plain sight
Felt so close
Just slipped away
Missed the mark
Cooking chaos
Made a mess
Burnt the toast
In a hurry
Rushed and wrong
Spoke too soon
Good vibes
Feels just right
In the groove
Left on read
Still waiting...
Ghosted again
Burnt the toast
Culinary chaos
Kitchen fail
No gas left
Just vibes
Running on empty
Forgot your password
Was it your cat’s name?
Access denied
Dropped your snack
3-second rule?
Floor feast
Strange phone call
Heavy breathing
Unknown number
Asked for opinions
Got way too many
Unsolicited advice
Gave a look
Said everything
Side eye deluxe
Slow morning start
No rush at all
Lazy weekend
Eyes everywhere
They’re watching
Secret spy
Sunday state of mind
No rush, no rules
Stay in bed
A sword in the stone
Only one can pull it free
Chosen one
Slipped on a banana
Classic comedy moment
Fruit fall
Forgot the punchline
Still told the joke
Awkward pause
Talking to yourself
And you lost the argument
Self roast
Truth buried deep
Don’t dig too far
Skeleton closet
Blast from the past
Feels like yesterday
Time capsule
Twists and turns
Hard to follow
Brain maze
Forgot the homework
Again
Serial slacker
Apartment mayhem
It’s always something
Roommate drama
Best friend energy
Knows your chaos
Dynamic duo
Told the joke
Nobody laughed
Tough crowd
Laughed too early
It wasn’t the punchline
Premature giggle
Practiced cool line
Mumbled the whole thing
Failed delivery
Tried a new recipe
Fire alarm went off
Cooking gone wild
Late night confidence
Morning regrets
Sleepy brain storm
