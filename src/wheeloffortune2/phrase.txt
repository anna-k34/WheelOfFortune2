Just Plain Stuck
No matter how much you try, you're not budging
Wiggle out of it
Not even close

Way over yonder
Fizzled out

Bubble over
Almost tasted it

Juicy and Delicious
But not enough

Quite a few
Just seven letters

Fix it up
A lack of clarity

Out of focus
Too far out there

Out of whack
This one hurt

I goofed up
Around the house

A shelf full of knickknacks
Fictional Character

A damsel in distress
Fun and games

Wheel of fortune
